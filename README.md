# 3D_Character_Animation
## Introduction
In this project, I use a combination of software tools to create a 3D character model, rig it with animations, and control its movement within a Babylon.js Playground.

To experience the project in action, please import the code into Babylon.js Playground at https://playground.babylonjs.com/.
